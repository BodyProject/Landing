						<span>ALAN TESTIMONIAL</span>
						<p>Over the past few years I had put on a lot of weight and peaked at 21 Stone. I felt miserable about myself and managed to lose some weight on my own but after a while I had plateaued and couldn’t shift anyway more weight, despite going to the gym 4-5 times a week and also doing 3 spinning classes a week.</p>
						<p>A friend of mine told me that it he felt that weight loss was as much about what you eat as how you exercise. At a networking event I got chatting to a guy and the topic turned to weight loss and exercise and he told me about the meals and training programme that Body Project was running.</p>
						<p>I made contact with Body Project and met with Gillian the following day. I was impressed with her professionalism and also the facilities. I was going on holiday in five weeks and decided to do the 4 week food and training program.</p>
						<p>The first 10 days were very tough, gone was the daily sugar rush from muffins, corn flakes, pasta and the like, and in their place were lots of protein and vegetable based meals, which were very tasty. I won’t pretend I found it easy but the results began to show nearly straight away. By the tenth day I had already dropped 10 pounds. As my appetite adjusted I found that the sugar cravings went, I was less cranky and stopped feeling bloated after meals that I usually got on my old diet. By the end of the program I’d lost 5 inches off my stomach alone. I had to go and buy new clothes as nothing fitted me!</p>
						<p>Body Project’s program has reset my eating habits, gone are the muffins, the fish & chips and the take aways. I find I eat healthier and smaller portions. I am also still doing fitness training with Body Project and I continue to lose weight and have now lost two stone, and a further two inches off my waist, since I started the program just over 2 months ago. I’m very happy to no longer be shopping for XL or XXL clothes.</p>
						<p>My friends are amazed at how I look and one friend told me it was the best she had seen me look in the 22 years she knows me.</p>
						<p>Taking on the program is not easy, there is a lot of hard work involved and a lot of temptation to break the diet along the way, but persistence pays off. I would recommend to anyone who wants to get in shape and lose their bad eating habits to do Body Project’s program, the results speak for themselves.</p>

						<span>PAULINE TESTIMONIAL</span>
						<p>My weight has fluctuated a lot in the last fifteen years since I gave up sport. I’d try various diets and lose weight (counting calories and points and just waiting to ‘live’ again) only to put it all back on again and more. Over the last 3 to 4 years my weight gradually increased (putting up a further 2 and a half stone) while my activity levels decreased significantly. The additional weight caused problems with my breathing, I had little to no energy, and I found it difficult to motivate myself to tackle the problem. The turning point for me was New Year’s Eve 2013. I was 16st 12lbs and was feeling and looking very unhealthy. It was a photo taken that night that spurred me into action – I knew then that I had to do something about it.</p>
						<p>That ‘something’ was working with Gillian who was recommended to me by a work colleague. At my first session Gillian went through my diet in detail and gave me advice on where I had been going wrong, suggesting that I eat natural, non-refined, low GI foods, prepare my own meals and cut down significantly on tea and coffee. I now prepare all my own meals based on Gillian’s recommendations regarding healthy fats, healthy carbohydrates and protein.</p>
						<p>My activity plan, aside from my sessions with Gillian, consisted of daily walks, starting out at 20 minutes working up to 50 minutes every day, along with some cycling at the weekends plus Gillian’s designed home work out (kettlebells, weights, squats etc.) which I do at least 2-3 days per week.</p>
						<p>Gillian monitors my food and activity diary on a weekly basis and continues to give me great pointers on both my food plan and activity levels and this has continued to motivate me.</p>
						<p>By the end of the first month I had lost a stone, and the weight loss has remained steady since. Within four and a half months I had lost a total of 4 stone and reduced my waist by 8.5 inches.</p>
						<p>At nine months I have lost 6st and 2lbs, I reached and slightly exceeded my goal of 11 stone (I am now 10st 10lbs) and have reduced my waistline by 13 and a half inches and reduced my body fat by over 28%.</p>
						<p>My energy levels have increased 500% and for the first time in my life I like how I look, and I am also enjoying and looking forward to life in a way that I have not in many years, My family, friends and colleagues cannot believe the changes in me, (on several occasions people literally have not recognised me) – they are even asking me for advice on how to lose weight!</p>
						<p>I have tried a Personal Trainer before and gave up after two sessions but something just “clicked” with Gillian, she pushes me but also knows when I have ‘had enough’ and her clear, no nonsense approach to healthy eating is definitely what has made the crucial difference in my weight loss.</p>
						<p>With my goal loss now reached, I now plan to continue working with Gillian to tone up and reduce my body fat even further.</p>
						<p>I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Body Project to anyone who wants to lose weight and change their lifestyle.</p>

						<span>KATHERINE TESTIMONIAL</span>
						<p>I used to eat relatively healthily but had a serious addiction to chocolate which was my total downfall. My nickname was the ‘hungry angry monster’ because my blood sugars (and mood!) would peak and trough throughout the day – I was chasing the sugar high. Truth be told I thought this was normal. When bikini time swung around I would go all out and shed maybe 4-5 lbs just to pile it on again when on holidays. Slowly my weight gradually crept up and up. That said I was still exercising regularly but never overly pushing myself. Plus I thought nothing of having the same size dinner as my brother or boyfriend. What’s the problem?</p>
						<p>One day I saw myself in a photo and got a fright. I had a big belly and wide rear! I had been lugging myself around feeling very sluggish but this was the wake up call that I needed. It was time to take action. I’m in my mid 30s and realised that if I didn’t do it now, I never would. I wanted noticeable results but not a quick fix. I wanted something to help break my sugar habits and motivate a lifestyle change. Your body changes as you get older (unfortunately!).</p>
						<p>I started researching and came across Body Project’s weight loss programme with 3 personal training sessions a week along with all meals catered for. The meals were a huge plus for me as I cleaned my kitchen of all food leaving no temptation to hand. Plus I had to commit to making time to make my training sessions. No excuses! Truthfully the first week was hard – withdrawals from the sugar, smaller portion sizes than I was used to, and hitting the gym like never before. But after the first week I lost 5lbs. If that’s not motivation nothing is. By week 2 my appetite had shrunk and I had more energy and was sleeping soundly. There’s one ‘sensible’ cheat day a week too which allowed me the flexibility to head out with pals.</p>
						<p>After my 4 weeks, I feel brill. The weight training has left me fitter and stronger and I have lost 14lbs and counting. I’ve lost 10.5 inches overall – 3.5″ off my waist and a further 2.5″ off my hips and thighs. I have not been this slim in 15 years, and I can’t quite believe it! It’s been an education and I’ve made lasting changes to my everyday life. My shape has changed and I love how I’m feeling in my clothes. My sugar addiction is just a distant memory and I find it easy to slot 3 training sessions into my busy schedule. Organisation is key!</p>
						<p>I’m already on to my next fitness target and now it’s more about fitness than weight loss. Loving Body Project! The results say it all…I’m hooked!!</p>
